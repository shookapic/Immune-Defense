  description: The Lungs are a misty, branching labyrinth of bronchi and air sacs.
    Constant airflow pushes particles around, causing enemies to drift unpredictably
    between paths. Fog reduces visibility, occasionally obscuring enemy routes or
    tower ranges. Some pathogens become airborne, floating across terrain instead
    of following the ground pathways. The player must adapt to dynamic air currents
    and use towers that excel in close-quarters combat, as chokepoints can be narrow
    and volatile.
