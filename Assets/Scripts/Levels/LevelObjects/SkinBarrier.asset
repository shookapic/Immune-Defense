  description: "The Skin Barrier is the body\u2019s first line of defense, a sprawling
    open-field battleground where threats breach from countless micro-openings. The
    terrain is wide and exposed, forcing the player to think fast and build early
    defenses before pathogens spread across the surface. Environmental hazards such
    as fluctuating temperature or tiny abrasions can suddenly open new enemy pathways,
    keeping the pressure high. This level introduces core mechanics and encourages
    quick decision-making as enemies rush in faster than deeper in the body."
