  description: "The Brain is the most protected biome, with delicate neural pathways
    pulsing with electricity and thought. The terrain is narrower but packed with
    high-value nodes that can empower your towers\u2014or destabilize them if corrupted.
    Waves here are slower but smarter: enemies adapt, rerouting based on your defenses,
    and certain pathogens can disable towers temporarily through \"neural interference.\"
    This level demands careful planning and rewards strategic tower synergy. Failure
    means catastrophic damage, making every placement feel critical."
